# web-introduction
A learning guide to getting into web development and associated areas for a systems or embedded engineer.

# HTML & Markdown: 
A good place to start is to learn something simple and something you will use all the time. I enjoyed starting with learning HTML and Markdown side by side as they are similarly helpful in content generation and displaying a point.

# CSS & SASS:
The death of table-based layouts could not make me happier and I think all web developers everywhere should just forget about how we used to do things for manipulating displays. It wasn't healthy and they were terribly hacked together solutions that were almost impossible to reason about. Thanks to the hard work of a few very dedicated individuals we no longer have to hack our web document together and we should all be using CSS grid. The difference in thinking is transformational and is best described as past verse present thinking. In the past we have been stuck with applying a layout to an individual item and relating that to the whole document otherwise thought of as content-out and one-dimensional. The present allows for two-dimensional layout-in tool to create a layout and drop items into areas or zones in defined layout.

# Javascript:
The fundamental language used in order to interact with the web platform. It's a quickly evolving specification and new features are coming out on a yearly basis now! However, with the obsession of frameworks, libraries, and turn-key solutions in Web Development; I think it is more important than ever to have a good foundational knowledge of the language that makes the web an end users paradise. I highly recommend this book as its free to download and it goes through everything there is for you to begin your Web Development journey.
